# Durable Functions for PowerShell

This repo hosts the standalone Durable Functions SDK for PowerShell. Compared to the Durable Functions SDK that comes built-in with the Azure Functions PowerShell worker, this standalone SDK contains performance enhancements, more features, and key bug fixes that would have required a breaking release. For more information on this release, please see [this article](TODO).

> The standalone Durable Functions SDK implementation is currently in **preview**. For production workloads, we recommend continuing to use the built-in Durable Functions SDK which is hosted in [this repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-powershell-worker).

## About Durable Functions
 [Durable Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview) is an extension of [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview) that lets you write stateful functions in a serverless compute environment. The extension lets you define stateful workflows by writing orchestrator functions and stateful entities by writing entity functions using the Azure Functions programming model. Behind the scenes, the extension manages state, checkpoints, and restarts for you, allowing you to focus on your business logic.
